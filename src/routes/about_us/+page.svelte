			Jessie is a native Floridian and an avid outdoorsman that is always looking for a new

			When a friend asked for Jessie’s help moving a hive of bees from his property, Jessie got the

			surrounded by orange groves. They have dogs, cows, chickens, and birds of prey on their funny
			farm. Jessie’s love for nature drew him to help birds of prey survive there first year of
			life. But Beth’s love of honey drew them to the bees and now they would like you to try their
			sweet backyard raw honey.
